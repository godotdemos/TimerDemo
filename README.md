# TimerDemo
Based on [the GamesFromScratch tutorial](http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2015/01/22/Godot-Engine-Tutorial-Part1-Your-First-Godot-Application.aspx), a demonstration of a timed counter in Godot.
This repo is part of an ongoing series of tutorials, in hopes of exploring many different aspects of the [Godot Game Engine](http://www.godotengine.org/wp/)
